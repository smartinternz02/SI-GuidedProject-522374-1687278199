### ABSTRACT                                                                                                                                          

This project aims to analyse and visualize the trends and patterns of suicide cases in India from 2001 to 2012. Suicide is a critical social issue, and understanding its patterns can help in devising effective preventive measures and mental health interventions. The project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to present the data in an interactive and insightful manner.

### INTRODUCTION
i) Overview:
            Suicide is a difficult topic to discuss, but it's an issue that affects many people in India. In fact, according to data from 2001 to 2012, suicide rates in India have been steadily increasing. It's important that we talk about this issue and work together to prevent it.
            Visualizing this data can help us better understand the scope of the problem and identify areas where interventions may be most effective. By looking at the numbers, we can see that suicide is not just a personal tragedy, but a public health concern that requires our attention and action.

ii) Purpose:
            This project intimates the suicidal reports held In the year 2002-2012.In this project,we have visualized the reports by using bubble chart, pie chart, etc.This project helps to collect data from many sources and convert it to useful that can be utilized to data driven choices.
            This project helps to understand the cause of the issue in an easy manner. This project helps to connect with several data sources, analyse data and visualize it to get superior insights.

### LITERATURE SURVEY
Existing problem:
Using Data visualization one can easily connect, extract data and draw visualizations from any data source having different data representations.
As relevant data points grow exponentially, it becomes challenging to use traditional dashboards to track these metrics and make informed timely decisions.

Proposed solution:
To deploy any reports or applications we need to check lot of things like frame work, folder permissions, etc. Without worrying about all these issues, in tableau we can deploy our projects, data sources & workbooks easily.
Grouping and correlating multiple anomalies by design, Anodot’s AI-powered analytics elevates the essential insights first. By learning the normal behaviour of millions of metric’s, Anodot detects only the most impactful incidents and alerts relevant teams at the start.

### EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
There have been very few articles that have dealt exclusively with suicide preventive strategies or with a scientific and systematic evaluation of a strategy.

Singh[47] in his article evaluated the various suicide prevention activities such as the community activities, the psychiatric and medical activities, suicide prevention centers, psychiatric emergency services, crises intervention centers, role of general practitioners, research and media. He concluded by stressing on the role of the psychiatrist in dealing with this issue.

Venkoba Rao[48] in his article delineated the risk factors associated with suicidal attempts and its association with psychiatric disorders and the biological evidence for suicidal behaviour. The article based on cited studies recommended that education of general physicians, limiting access to availability of antidepressants, paracetamol and pesticides would lower the rates of suicide.

Jena and Siddharta[49] reviewed articles on non fatal suicidal attempts of adolescents in both Indian and international literature. They stated that non fatal suicidal behaviour among adolescents needs to be evaluated and managed effectively in order to reduce the rates. They concluded that Indian studies in this area are a very few and there is a great need to conduct research in this area. The article also stresses the importance for professionals like general practitioners, teachers, paediatricians, school counsellors to be trained to identify non fatal suicide behaviours in adolescents so as to facilitate referral and effective management.

Vijayakumar[50] in an editorial expresses the urgent need for suicide prevention in India and stresses that suicide is a multifaceted problem and hence suicide prevention programs should also be multidimensional. In India, suicide prevention is more of a social and public health objective than a traditional exercise in the mental health sector. She concludes by saying that the time is ripe for mental health professionals to adopt proactive and leadership roles in suicide prevention and save the lives of thousands of young Indians.

### Advantages of using Tableau:
Visualization can be a very spiritual practice. Precise visualizations and clarity of mind can take you deeper within yourself, facilitating a powerful connection to the sacred. Visualization is a great access point for meditation and can help you move deeper into stillness and connection with your higher power and higher self.
There are three things you should know when it comes to data visualization. The first is that data visualization has become a faster, more effective communication and motivation tool. This has happened due to the second point of data visualization: people are, by and large, visual learners.
Data visualization tools are, simply put, an awesome sales tool.; Advances in technology have caused us to change our preconceived notions surrounding data presentation. What we once saw as dull and mundane, can now be seen as beautiful.

### Disadvantages of using Tableau:
It requiring more time, effort, and skills to design, develop, and maintain than static charts, and potentially increasing the complexity and cost of the data analysis process.
It gives assessment not exactness – While the information is exact in foreseeing the circumstances, the perception of similar just gives the assessment.


***

### APPLICATIONS

1. Data visualization and reporting: Tableau is widely used for creating visually appealing and interactive data visualizations, charts, and reports. It allows users to present complex data in a clear and understandable format, enabling stakeholders to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

2. Data exploration and discovery: Data visualization facilitates data exploration by providing an intuitive interface to interact with data. Users can apply filters, drill down into details, and perform ad-hoc analysis to uncover hidden insights and relationships within the data.

3. Geospatial analysis and mapping: Data visualization has robust geospatial capabilities, allowing users to create maps and perform geospatial analysis. It supports various map visualizations, including point maps, heat maps, and plethora maps. This is useful for analysing location-based data, identifying geographical patterns, and making spatially informed decisions.

4. Healthcare analytics: Data visualization is increasingly used in the healthcare industry for analysing patient data, monitoring healthcare outcomes, and improving operational efficiency. It aids in visualizing clinical data, tracking disease outbreaks, identifying healthcare trends, and optimizing resource allocation.

5. Human resources analytics: Tableau assists HR professionals in analysing and visualizing workforce data. It helps in tracking employee performance, identifying talent gaps, monitoring employee engagement, and generating HR reports and dashboards.

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the visualizations of suicides in India from 2001 to 2012 provide important insights into the patterns and trends of this critical issue. Through the analysis of available data, several key observations can be made:

1. Overall Increase: The visualizations reveal a general increase in the number of suicides in India during the specified period. This suggests a growing concern and highlights the need for proactive measures to address mental health and social factors contributing to suicides.

2. Gender Disparity: There is a noticeable gender disparity in suicide rates, with males consistently accounting for a higher proportion of suicides compared to females. This pattern should prompt targeted interventions and awareness campaigns aimed at understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by different genders.

3. Age Distribution: The visualizations demonstrate variations in suicide rates across different age groups. Certain age ranges, such as young adults and elderly individuals, appear to be more vulnerable to suicide. This highlights the importance of targeted support and mental health services tailored to these specific age demographics.

4. Regional Disparities: The data visualizations indicate variations in suicide rates across different states and regions of India. It is crucial to recognize and understand the underlying factors contributing to these regional disparities, such as socioeconomic conditions, cultural factors, and access to mental health resources.

5. Causes and Contributing Factors: While the visualizations do not explicitly provide information on the causes of suicides, they serve as a starting point for identifying potential contributing factors. Further research and analysis are necessary to delve deeper into the underlying causes, including mental health issues, societal pressures, economic stress, and relationship problems.

6. Need for Mental Health Support: The visualizations emphasize the urgent need for increased mental health support and awareness campaigns in India. Initiatives should focus on reducing stigma, improving access to mental health services, and promoting mental well-being at the individual, community, and societal levels.

Overall, the visualizations of suicides in India from 2001 to 2012 shed light on the magnitude and complexity of the issue. They underscore the importance of adopting a multi-faceted approach that combines preventive measures, early intervention, policy changes, and community engagement to effectively address the challenge of suicide in India.


***


### FUTURE SCOPE
1.Conduct a longitudinal study to analyze suicide trends in India beyond 2012, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the issue over time.
2. Examine the role of access to mental health services and support systems in different regions of India to determine gaps and areas for improvement.
3. Analyze the influence of media reporting on suicides and its potential impact on suicide rates, exploring responsible reporting guidelines and their effectiveness.
4. Conduct qualitative research, such as interviews or focus groups, to gather personal narratives and insights into the underlying causes and experiences related to suicides.
5. Assess the effectiveness of existing suicide prevention programs and initiatives in India, identifying successful strategies and areas requiring further attention.
6. Explore the impact of educational initiatives on mental health awareness and suicide prevention, evaluating the effectiveness of school-based programs and awareness campaigns.
7. Investigate the correlation between substance abuse and suicide rates, examining the prevalence of substance use disorders as a contributing factor in suicides.
